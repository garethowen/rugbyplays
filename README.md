rugby set piece play animations, vanilla html5
http://plays.solingenzebras.de

I developed this when I was coaching a local rugby team. 
So the players could learn the team's playbook on their smart phone.

Technically:

- set-pieces are defined in code as json
- a set-pieceis defined by specifying the positions of players at different times/key frames
- buttons are generated for each set play defined
- the play is rendered using key-frame animation when the corresponding button is pressed
- pure html5/javascript, no frameworks
- serverless
